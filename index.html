    <h2>What are National Parks?</h2>
    <p>A national park is a natural park in use for conservation purposes, created and protected by national governments. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a government declares or owns. Although individual countries designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. National parks are almost always open to visitors.</p>

        <h3>Why do we need National Parks?</h3>
        <p class="para">National parks preserve nature’s great areas of wilderness and are often focused on the preservation of extraordinary areas or symbolic or important species. Preserving biodiversity is complicated by the fact that any change in an area’s ecosystem can have large and unpredictable effects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="np">
        <h3> Tourism</h3>
        <p class="para">Tourism to national parks has increased considerably over time. In Costa Rica for example, a megadiverse country, tourism to parks has increased by 400% from 1985 to 1999. The term national park is perceived as a brand name that is associated with nature-based tourism and it symbolizes a "high quality natural environment with a well-designed tourist infrastructure".</p>
    </div>
    <div class="np">
        <h3>Sustainable Development Goal</h3>
        <p class="para">Goal 15 of the Sustainable Development Agenda (SDG 15) is to stop the loss of biodiversity and to safeguard, restore, and encourage the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, including forests. India's national parks can make a major contribution in accomplishing this aim. Here is a specific goal for India's national parks that is in line with SDG 15. <br>
             The main Objecive is to protect biodiversity and build ecosystem resilience, improve the conservation and sustainable management of terrestrial ecosystems in India's National Parks by 2030.
